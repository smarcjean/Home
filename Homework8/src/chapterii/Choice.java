	/* I suggest that he uses the Map Collection because this collection takes two 
	 * parameters and it assign a key to a value. It will be able to assign each book
	 * to a specific value or ID. That is the best Collection for such an operation.
	 * Because if you are looking for a book this Collection will let you enter either
	 * the key or the value to find the book and that is a great advantage over the
	 * other Collections. HashMap does not put its items or objects in order, while TreeMap put
	 * its items or objects in order. So, the better choice would be to use TreeMap.
	 * 
	 * My justification is that you may want to find a book but you only remember the 
	 * Id number of the book and with the Map Collection you will still be able to
	 * find the book without remembering or needing to know the name of the book.
